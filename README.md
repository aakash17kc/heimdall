# Heimdall

## Test Reporting Tool

Heimdall is a Test Reporting Tool which is primarily built to publish your test execution results to the google sheets from
 
    a.Server(like Jenkins) 
    b.Local 
  
and notifies the recipients through the Communication channels (like Slack). This tool helps the recipients/users to know the current status of their products by executing the test cases just on a button click. Helps the recipients/users to make decisions for release instantaneously  and brings the transparency between your product and it's state.

### **Requirements**

2.Mobility Stream jira plugin (Helps to  Export Test cases to a Google Sheet and  maintain Realtime sync with Jira. You can use jira cloud plugin as well )

3.An Exported Test Cases Google sheet from the Mobility Stream Plugin (Acts as a source of Test Cases)

4.An Imported Google sheet (using Importrange) from sheet Generated in step(3) (Acts as a source to operate Heimdall )

5.Amazon s3 Account (Push the Test Execution Results)

6.Jenkins Job (Execute Test cases in Real Time)

7.Maven Automation projects (like cucumber/Karate for UI/API)

8.Tagged scenario's with feature files (Helps to Generate Reports at Tag level)
